# About

<div in:fade|global class="content">
<ins>The Revival Archive is dedicated to keeping track of active and defunct old brickbuilding private servers.</ins>

We also review revivals on specific features such as:

-   Website
    -   This rating is influenced by how good the revival website is - function, form and features.
-   Community
    -   This rating is influenced by the activity of the community and the behaviour (including administrators.)
-   Client
    -   This rating is influenced by the activity of exploits, features (toolbox, etc), and ease of access (downloading, joining servers)
-   Overall
    -   This rating is a conclusion of all the previous ratings and this rating will be the one shown in the index.

We have a blog post where we go over recent events in the community (such as popular revivals going defunct, upcoming revivals, etc).

Revivals can also be featured in the _Revival Of The Month_, a special place where one revival is, in our opinion - the best revival for users to join at the moment.
There can't be more than one _Revival Of The Month_ obviously, so we also have a featured section where we recommend other good revivals. Additionally, if you own a revival, you can request to be on the featured section!

We do not provide any revival clients for security reasons.
